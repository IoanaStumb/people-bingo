# People Bingo

A simple online [People Bingo](https://www.howdoyouplay.net/icebreakers/how-to-play-people-bingo.html) game.

### See it live

This is published via Github Pages [here](https://ioanastumb.github.io/people-bingo/).


### Run it

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so after doing the usual NodeJs apps dance (install NodeJs and npm, install the project Node modules, cry in frustration because something doesn't work) all you should have to do is run `npm start` and it'll be available on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.


Happy playing!
